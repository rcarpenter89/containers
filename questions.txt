Hi team,

As part of our longer-term roadmap, our team will eventually be taking over responsibility for the automation portion of Illumio containers in addition to container ringfencing. To be clear — this is not happening right now. At this stage, I’m gathering background and documentation to make the eventual transition smooth for everyone.

To help with this, I’d like to set up some time with you to understand:

Where the current automation code/configs live (repos, files, Helm values, etc.)

How the automation is structured today (scope, pipelines, manual vs. automated steps)

Label mapping logic (Kubernetes metadata → Illumio labels)

Cluster-specific configs and how infra rules are managed

Logging, visibility, and how failures are handled

Known risks/gaps or lessons learned so far

I’ll be using a structured list of questions during our discussion to capture details consistently (repo structure, ownership, CI/CD triggers, versioning, etc.). My goal is not to disrupt ongoing work, but to build a clear picture of how things are set up today so when the transition does happen, we’re prepared.

Please let me know a good time that works for you all to walk through this together. In the meantime, if there are any docs, diagrams, or KBs you think I should review first, I’d appreciate the pointers.

Thanks in advance for the partnership — looking forward to learning from what you’ve built so far.


Questions for Illumio Container Automation Handover
1. Repository & File Location

Where does the automation code live (GitHub, Azure DevOps, internal Git, etc.)?

Is there a dedicated repo for container automation or shared with other Illumio automation (VM, enforcement, labeling)?

What’s the folder structure (e.g., illumio-k8s/labels/, helm/, scripts/)?

Are there templates/values.yaml files committed for different clusters (DV/QA/PD)?

How are secrets (API keys, org IDs) managed — config files, K8s secrets, or external vault?

2. Automation Scope

Which parts of container lifecycle are automated today?

Label mapping from K8s → Illumio (env/app/role/loc)?

Helm chart deployment of Kubelink + C-VEN?

Enforcement rollout (Visibility → Low → Full)?

Rule/ruleset creation for cluster infra?

Label drift correction?

What is still manual (engineers log into PCE, apply rules, etc.)?

3. Pipeline & Process

Is automation run manually (on demand) or via a CI/CD pipeline?

If CI/CD:

Which pipeline (Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, Jenkins)?

What triggers runs (commit, CRQ, schedule)?

How do we track success/failures (logs, alerts)?

Is there a promotion model (DV → QA → PD) for automation changes?

How do engineers test changes safely before production?

4. Labeling & Mapping

How do we map Kubernetes metadata to Illumio labels?

Namespace → env?

Workload name → app?

Other annotations → role/loc?

Where is this mapping logic defined (script, Helm chart, ConfigMap)?

Do we have exceptions (special workloads that need custom labels)?

Is there a fallback behavior if labels don’t match (default role/location)?

5. Cluster-Specific Setup

Do we maintain separate configs for DV/QA/PD clusters, or a single templated set?

How are mandatory infra rules applied for each cluster?

How are new clusters bootstrapped (is there a documented runbook)?

6. Versioning & Upgrades

How do we track which Illumio for Kubernetes chart version each cluster is on?

How are Helm values updated when Illumio releases new versions (manual or automated)?

Do we validate PCE version compatibility before upgrades?

7. Logging & Visibility

Do automation scripts generate logs? Where are they stored (Splunk, log server, local)?

Do we have a way to audit changes (who ran automation, what labels/policies were applied)?

Is there a status dashboard for container automation health?

8. Ownership & Contacts

Who are the primary engineers responsible for Illumio container automation today?

Is there a Slack/Teams channel dedicated to automation discussions?

Are there ServiceNow KBs or Confluence pages documenting the workflows?

9. Risks & Gaps

What common failures do we see (labels missing, pods not discovered, policy gaps)?

How are failures currently remediated (manual fixes, rollback script)?

Where do we see the biggest gaps in automation today?

What’s the roadmap — e.g., moving more into CLAS mode automation, or adding ruleset automation?

10. Next Steps for You

Ask if there’s a sandbox cluster where you can run/test automation safely.

Request examples of recent commits/CRQs to see how changes are made.

Identify if automation is meant to scale across all clusters or if each cluster still has unique handling.
